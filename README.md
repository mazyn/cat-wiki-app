The CatWiki let's you search for information and pictures of your favourite cat breed! üê± Learn more about their personality, origin, life-span, and much more! You can see the working demo [here](https://cat-wiki-mazyn.herokuapp.com).

I built this project using **Angular**, a technology that I've worked with since 2018. I also used **Nest**, which is an incredible framework I've been wanting to use for a long time! I've also learned a lot about **Tailwind**, my new favourite CSS framework to work on modern applications!

Overall, it was a pretty fun project to work on. I've learned a lot and revisited a bunch of technologies that I usually don't work with on a daily-basis. It was an excellent challenge proposed by the [Devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io) team!

Also, I'm cat lover, onwer of 4 cats ü§é

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/f4NJ53rcfgrP6sBMD2jt) was to build an application to complete the given user stories:

* üîç Search for cat breeds and select a breed of your choice
* ü•≥ See the most popular searched cat breeds summary on the homepage
* üîü See the top 10 most searched cat breeds
* üìä See the breed details including description, temperament, origin, life span, adaptability, affection level, child-friendly, grooming, intelligence, health issues, social needs, stranger friendly
* üì∏ See photos of the breeds
* üì± On mobile, when the user selects the search option, a modal for breed search should pop up
* üîó Go to an article about cats when clicking on read more on "Why you should have a cat" section
* ‚û°Ô∏è Go to the top 10 cats by clicking "see more" in the dashboard

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

> üß∂ Regarding the package manager
> 
> For better compatibility, we recommend using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as your main package manager, since the project was built using it. You can try running the project with _npm_, and it will probably run fine. But beware that there might be bugs or unexpected behaviours in the application.

### Cloning the repos

From your command line:
```bash
# Clone the cat wiki api repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mazyn/cat-wiki-api

# Then, clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mazyn/cat-wiki-app
```

### Installing dependencies

After that, CD into the api folder, then install the dependencies by running:
```bash
$ yarn
```

Or with npm
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Configuring your environment

Next, you should configure an `.env` file, using the pre-existing [`.env.example`](https://github.com/mazyn/cat-wiki-api/blob/master/.env.example) file in the project as a template. If you want to know more about dotenv files, you can read this [article](https://www.codementor.io/@parthibakumarmurugesan/what-is-env-how-to-set-up-and-run-a-env-file-in-node-1pnyxw9yxj) about it.

Be aware that you'll need a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) instance running on your local machine, or on [Docker](https://www.docker.com), for the API to run properly. After that, you'll just need to set the DATABASE_URL in the `.env` file.

**You'll also need an API key from the https://thecatapi.com, so make sure to go there and get your key!**

### Running the API

To run the app, first start the API service on _development_ mode. This will start the service listening on **PORT** `8080` _(you can change this in the `.env` file)_:
```bash
$ yarn run start:dev
```

You should see an output similar to this:
```
[3:54:26 PM] Starting compilation in watch mode...

[3:54:28 PM] Found 0 errors. Watching for file changes.

[Nest] 217982  - 08/30/2022, 3:54:29 PM     LOG [NestFactory] Starting Nest application...
...
[Nest] 217982  - 08/30/2022, 3:54:29 PM     LOG [Bootstrap] Environment: DEVELOPMENT
...
[Nest] 217982  - 08/30/2022, 3:54:29 PM     LOG [Bootstrap] üöÄ Server ready at http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Running the app

Lastly, to run the app, CD into the `cat-wiki-app` folder. Then, edit the `src/environments/environment.ts` file, and replace the `catApiUrl` property with the url of the API you just started. Like so:

```js
  catApiUrl: "http://localhost:8080/v1" // don't forget to add the "/v1" at the end!
```

Install the app dependencies:
```bash
$ yarn
```

Then, just run the app üòâ
```bash
$ yarn start
```

You should see an output like the following:
```
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **


‚úî Compiled successfully.
```

That's it! Now you have the CatWiki App running locally on your machine! ü•≥
